          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>How big is your concern about your health, and what is your estimation of your exposure to health risks? A recent study based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System has revealed correlations between age, income, and health risk. </p>

          <p>As the diagram demonstrates, people's health risk is shaped by different socioeconomic in different ways. Poverty is shown to correlate with increased health risk exposure positively in all aspects.</p>

          <p>Interestingly, age seems to have contrasting impacts on health risk as higher age is positively correlated to better health care access while this appears to lead to increased smoking. Finally, lower-income is also associated with higher health risks.</p>
